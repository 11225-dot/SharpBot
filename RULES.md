## Discord Rules

> Thanks to [@abyssvi](https://github.com/abyssvi), I know have [this quote](https://github.com/hammerandchisel/discord-api-docs/issues/69#issuecomment-223898291) as proof of these rules.

There is some question as to the rules about selfbots, whether you'll get banned for having one, stuff like that. I've had a hard time finding any _official_ statement one way or another, but as far as I can tell these are the general rules:

1.  A selfbot must not, under any circumstance, respond to other user's messages. This means it should not respond to commands, should not autoreply to certain keywords, etc. You must be the only one that can control it.
2. A selfbot must not, under any circumstance, do "invite scraping". This is the action of detecting server invites in chat, and automatically joining a server using that invite.
3. As selfbots run under your account, they are subject to the same Terms of Service. This means that they should not spam, insult or demean others, post NSFW material, spread viruses or illegal material, etc. They have to follow the same rules that you follow.

*Because of rule \#1 I've had to remove the `//afk` feature, as it would reply to other users when you were @mentioned.*
