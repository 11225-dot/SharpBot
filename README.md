# Root's Selfbot

This is the selfbot I use in my every day dealings with Discord. 

It's built in Discord.js version 9.2.0 (at the moment)

## Downloading

Have git installed on your machine and run the following command:

`git pull https://github.com/eslachance/djs-selfbot-v9.git`

Once finished: 

- `cd djs-selfbot-v9`
- `npm install`
- Rename `selfbot.sqlite.example` to `selfbot.sqlite`
- Rename `config.json.example` to `config.json`
- Edit `config.json` and enter your token

> To get your token, do CTRL+SHIFT+I in Discord, type in `localStorage.token` and copy it.

Then start the bot using 
`node self.js`

For support join the [Discord.js Official server](https://discord.gg/bRCvFy9) and speak to `root`.
